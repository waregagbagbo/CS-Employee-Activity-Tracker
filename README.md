## Employee Activity Tracker for Customer Support 

A Django-based system for customer support teams to log end-of-shift reports and provide managers/supervisors with real-time visibility into team activities and performance.

## API Endpoints
### Authentication
 - POST /api/auth/login/ - User login
 - POST /api/auth/logout/ - User logout
 - POST /api/auth/refresh/ - Refresh JWT token. Also updates session-based auth tokens for compatibility with the accounts app.

### Employee Management (Viewsets)/Generic

Uses a custom AbstractUser model with email as the primary identifier. <br> Signals ensure automatic profile creation and token regeneration on user creation.

 - GET /api/employees/ - List employees (paginated)
 - GET /api/employees/{id}/ - Get employee details
 - PUT /api/employees/{id}/ - Update employee profile

### Shift Management (Viewsets)


 - GET /api/shifts/ - List shifts (with filters)
 - POST /api/shifts/ - Create new shift
 - GET /api/shifts/{id}/ - Get shift details
 - PUT /api/shifts/{id}/ - Update shift
 - PATCH /api/shifts/{id}/start/ - Start shift
 - PATCH /api/shifts/{id}/end/ - End shift

### Activity Reports (Viewsets)

 - GET /api/reports/ - List reports (with filters)
 - POST /api/reports/ - Submit new report
 - GET /api/reports/{id}/ - Get report details
 - PUT /api/reports/{id}/ - Update report (if not approved)
 - PATCH /api/reports/{id}/approve/ - Approve report (supervisors/managers only)
 - GET /api/reports/export/ - <b> Export reports (CSV)(Future) ONCE VALIDATED with Frontend library</b>
### Webhook Management

Webhooks are triggered on shift status changes (start/end). Implemented using Django signals and dispatched to registered endpoints test(https://webhook.site/). <br> 
Future support for multi-channel registry.

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- JWT, SessionAuth, and TokenAuth supported
- Role-based access control (supervisors, agents)
- Input validation and permission checks
- CORS configured for deployment

### Performance
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields (MySQL)
- Pagination via DRFâ€™s `PageNumberPagination` setting

### Architecture
- Modular design using ViewSets, signals, and custom user models.
- Webhook dispatch system for real-time notifications on shifts and reports. Testing ground (https://webhook.site/#!/view/a66fc247-bafa-41ce-93af-a408e52ea2b3)
